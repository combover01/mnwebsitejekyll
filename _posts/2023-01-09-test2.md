Officer Announcements: 
Josh (VP): 
Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to welcome you to the new semester by introducing the new - I don't know what I’m saying. It’s the general meeting, you all know why you’re here. I’m Josh, I’m the VP of this great establishment that no longer really has an establishment. I book reservations for the practice rooms but we really don’t have access right now because they installed Buzzcard readers without telling us and we’re locked out.
If you would like to get access eventually, you can go to Isabella after the meeting and pay her your semesterly practice room fees or your dues if you haven’t yet.

Sawyer (Booking Officer): 
 What’s up? I’m the booking officer so if you know any good books let me know. *halfhearted chuckles* That got a lot more reactions than usual.
1 announcement is that we’ll be doing a collab show at the Masq with Koyal, 2 other artists that we don’t know yet, 15,000 Guns, Solar Plexus Super Punch, and CD-Rom Com.
I’m gonna be posting a Google form. That’s the signup to get paired up for New Bands. New Bands is a thing where you can come with a band fully formed or fill out the form and we’ll pair you up based on interests and play in the New Bands Showcase, which will be in April. It’s an old MN tradition, and the prize for winning New Bands is you get to play at our semesterly music festival, 1000 Couches, which you should kumda. So fill out the form if you’d like to get grouped into a new band! Signups will come out a bit later.
You can also choose your own group too, but your group can’t have played a show before. 

 Isabella M (Treasurer): 
Hey guys I'm the treasure goblin, gobblin that treasure. Hopefully most people know the drill, but you come to me to pay your dues to become a super awesome member of MN. You get a silly little t-shirt and get to come to all of our lovely member-exclusive events like sound class, styrofoam, and screen printing. And for $20 a semester you can pay practice fees and reserve access to our lovely practice rooms.  
Just some housekeeping, please do not send my Venmo to anyone without talking to me. You need to come talk to me so I can keep track of everything. Also please don’t ask me to book practice times, that’s Josh’s job. I just take your money.

Mir (Studio Manager):  
Mir is currently stranded in New York with COVID.

Michael (Equipment Manager): 
I’m Michael, I’m the equipment manager. Mir is the studio manager who manages our studio, which will be set up soon, hopefully once Tech does the routing. I manage equipment and help run rentals. If you’re playing a show and need to rent equipment, there’s a form pinned in the general channel of the Discord. You can also email utcequipment@gmail.com for all your general equipment needs.
Also we do sound class on days that are tba this semester. We probably won’t start until after elections. Those are where we go over sound/music tech topics. It’s not like a school class, it’s a fun class. Sometimes I’ll bring donuts from Kroger.
If you need help recording, you can talk to Mir and he may help you. We don’t have a studio, so he may choose to help you outside of MN stuff.

Jimmy (Sound Boiys): 
 I am a sound boiy and also the sound boiy. I help Michael and Mir with their daily sound tasks. 
We have a Discord channel if you want to help out with the sound boiys. You can also run for this position, it’s really fun.
Yeah. Sound boys, soundin’ all the time.

Jacob/Isabella B (Open Mic Officers): 
Hello everybody I am Jacob also known as Zeigler also known as Jacob Zeigler. I am the other Isabella.
We’re 80% confident we’re having open mic this week. If we do it’ll be in the Cypress theater downstairs. Once Mir wakes up from his COVID slumber we’ll know for sure because he made the reservation.
The theme is French playwrights. I will do a jumping jack for every person.
Q: Does Le Mis count?
No!!
Q: Will open mic be in the same place every semester?
It’ll be in this building almost every week, either Cypress or Atlantic.



Ray (Ad King): 
Hey everybody. Happy new year. 2023 is GTMN’s year, so join the club. I’m the ad king of this establishment. I like to advertise, I like to make posts on Instagram like the one that you just saw today.
We have ad meetings, they’re awesome and probably the best meetings that happen in Musician’s Network.
If you guys want to run for an Ad Team position, you should come to our next meeting which is next Tuesday at 11. We have a lot according to our constitution.
Ad team is also kind of the bowling team. Sometimes we just bowl instead of having meetings.

Devin/Kiara (Ad Boiys): 
Ad boiys are 1 for 1 in 8Ball.

Sam (Secretary): 
Hey guys I’m the secretary of this club. I take meeting minutes in real time and send them to the Discord after. If you’re interested in typing, please let me know.

Kian (President): 
Hey guys I’m Kian, I’m the president.
Lots of cool stuff comin up. We have open mic possibly this week.	
Someone: Confirmed reservation.
We have open mic this week, so come recite your favorite monologue for No Exit.
We also have elections coming up in 2 weeks. We’re gonna send out a nomination form in the general channel where you can nominate yourself or someone else for a position in the club. Don’t go too crazy nominating everyone in the club or I’ll find you.
New Bands. So exciting. So many great bands have come out of this: Password:Password, Antarcticats, No Static, Blunderbus, and more. Lots of great Tech mythology. So if you’d like to make a new band, go crazy.
Important things coming up: Open mic. Ad meeting. When is that?
Ray: Tuesday at 11 except tomorrow because I have to go to the grocery store.
Can one of the ad boiys run it?
Devin: Devin will run the meeting.
We also have Groovy Thursday this Thursday happening at noon. We grab a bunch of instruments and go down to Tech Green and play music for an hour. It’s really fun and people look at you and ask what you’re doing and you say “it’s groovy thursday. get groovy.”
Isabella M: Fun Groovy Thursday fact: I met the one and only Nate Cooper at Groovy Thursday. So maybe you could too.
Nate Cooper was our old VP.
Sawyer: Booking officers are now 1 for 1 against sound boiys in 8Ball
Sawyer mentioned this, but 1000 Couches is our festival this semester! The theme has consistently been bring your own couch. Last year we had like 8 couches on Peters parking deck.

General Announcements:
Sawyer: For breakfast today I had this Panda Express. I slept through all my classes.
Ray: I’m performing at a show this Saturday! It's called Coldcore and it’s on Snyder Street. Ugly Joy, Birth Control, Squeamish, and It’s About Time are playing. Outdoors. Expected temperatures 30-40 degrees.
Someone: You’re doing a great job selling this.
I’m just reading the flyer out. It’s gonna be in a shed though. It’s a really warm shed.
Isabella M: I put my favorite shirt on today but before that I ate 2 pillsbury cinnamon rolls. 
Bryce: I did not have breakfast today.
Zeigler: Please talk to me if you want to record jazz music. I need instrumentalists, primarily saxophonists. Especially tenor saxophonists. Please talk to me.
What about recorder?
I don’t have need for a recorder player. But trumpet players. If you can imitate the tone of Miles Davis I’ll buy you Moes.
Simon: If breakfast is the first meal of the day I had a 2 liter diet coke because my flight got delayed and there was no food in my dorm.
Abhinav: I’m back to school and a TA for a class with 300 students, so you know a Piazza post is going out for 1000 Couches. I’ll be giving out chocolate chip cookies again for any of my students that can name the lineup. This is also my last semester at Tech and I will make sure Couchman vs. Buzz happens.
Dion: Hey! I go by Dion now and my new Instagram handle is sweater.paws. I really like playing open mic and I’d love  to play with more people. If anyone wants to jam please hit me up. And I ate Willage.
The whole building?
That’s where it went!
Kian: There's this funny little thing called music listening club. It’s this weird thing where this group of people get together and listens to three albums a week and then gets together to discuss them and nominate new ones. So they say. They also say they’re meeting in 30 minutes. This week is apparently MGMT’s entire discography.
Isabella M: I’m not on campus right now so hard cutoff for collecting money is 8:00. Remember that if you paid dues last semester you don’t need to this semester.
